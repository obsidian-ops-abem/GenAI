## Release Notes — intent-cli v0.6.2

> **Release model:** a maintainer/operator (or external release automation)  
> **creates and publishes the GitHub Release** for `v0.6.2` — the version-bump  
> merge does **not** create a Release or tag on its own. Publishing the GitHub  
> Release fires `.github/workflows/release.yml` (`on: release: published`), which  
> then builds and publishes the NuGet package and platform binary artifacts.  
> This packet is **prepare-only**: it authors the notes and adds **no** publish  
> steps. See the [pre-merge release-readiness gate](#release-readiness-gate-g558)  
> and [publishing v0.6.2](#publishing-v062).

## What's in v0.6.2

v0.6.2 is a **patch release** covering exactly the three slices merged after  
`v0.6.1`: **G555**, **G556**, and **G557**. It is a patch rather than a minor  
because nothing here changes a CLI surface: G555 and G556 are guide amendments,  
and G557 is a test/release-flow hotfix. No new commands, no removed or renamed  
arguments. The package id remains `JTechJapan.IntentSystem.Cli`; there are no  
package id, license, or workflow-semantics changes.

Two of the three close field incidents from the same day, and the third closes  
the failure that those incidents' own fix produced.

### Cross-project isolation on a shared machine (G555)

The provisioning and supervision guidance described how to build and keep **one**  
team; nothing said that other teams are running on the same machine. Operator  
incident (2026-07-29): with several project teams live at once, one project's  
design thread damaged another project's resources and the operator had to  
intervene by hand. A near-miss of the same class was avoided earlier that week  
only by ad-hoc discipline — verifying each pid's cwd before killing anything —  
discipline that lived in one session transcript rather than in the guide.

`guide orchestrator-thread` gains a cross-project isolation section. It narrows  
the **objects** a supervising thread may act on to its own team's; it does not  
change what it may **do**, so the supervision authority boundary is unchanged.

- **Attribution before mutation** — before injecting keys into a pane, killing a  
	process, closing or restructuring a workspace, or removing/rewriting a state  
	file, ownership is established from four keys: **workspace label**, **pane  
	cwd**, **process cwd** (read per pid — a pid list filtered by process *name*  
	attributes nothing), and **agmsg `(team, role)` file naming**. Attribution is a  
	positive result, not the absence of counter-evidence, and **unverifiable  
	attribution is read-only**: look, report, escalate — never mutate on a guess.
- **One workspace per team** (labelled with the team name, never reused or  
	borrowed) and **team-exclusive role folders**, with the folder-scoping reason  
	stated: agmsg identity and the codex bridge are folder-scoped, so an agent  
	started in another team's folder takes over *their* identity and delivery.
- **A shared-substrate ownership table** naming the sharing unit and ownership  
	rule for the workspace-manager server (per workspace, never the server), the  
	agmsg run directory (per `(team, role)` file, never a wholesale clear), codex  
	app-servers (per folder, cwd-verified), and the host repo (per domain path).
- **Non-destructive recovery** — preserve and set aside another project's damaged  
	artifacts (a broken artifact is still its owner's evidence), rebuild your own  
	fresh. **Recovery defaults to recreate, not cleanup.**

### Verified liveness — a startup report is not readiness (G556)

Field incident (2026-07-29): two codex agents sent startup-complete reports and  
died **seconds** later when their shared remote app-server was lost to a  
websocket transport reset, dropping both TUIs to shell prompts. The supervising  
design thread went on *"waiting for startup reports"* while every agent was  
already dead. The provisioning flow ended at the readiness ping — nothing  
required re-verification **after** the report — and the supervision pane scan  
named blocking dialogs but not a pane showing a shell prompt where an agent  
should be.

- **Verified liveness.** A role is provisioned when its startup report has  
	arrived **and**, after a **settle delay**, all three still pass: the pane still  
	hosts the agent TUI (read the pane — it is ground truth; a message is a claim  
	about the past), an agmsg ping-pong round trip succeeds **now**, and for codex  
	the bridge is armed with a stable app-server attachment. The settle delay is  
	load-bearing: the failure happens seconds *after* the report, so an instant  
	re-check merely re-observes the moment the report already described.
- **Early death is a normal mode**, with its signature named — the TUI exits to a  
	shell prompt, typically leaving a resume hint, after a **transport reset**  
	drops the app-server connection. That pane looks like an ordinary terminal,  
	which is why a dialog-only scan misses it. On a failed check the thread  
	**re-checks and recovers rather than waiting for another report**: a dead agent  
	sends nothing, so waiting is waiting forever.
- **`agent-absent`** joins the supervision pane-scan list as an equal stuck state  
	beside blocking dialogs, and routes by state rather than through dialog  
	handling — there is no dialog to answer. Recovery is a **shim-based relaunch**  
	(typed into the pane's interactive shell, recreating the app-server when that  
	is what died) followed by the **complete verified-liveness sequence** again.  
	The permission mode is set with the **launch flag** rather than switched  
	afterwards: synthetic key injection cannot be relied on for mode switching,  
	because modifier chords such as shift+tab are not delivered faithfully  
	(observed across multiple teams).
- **Shared app-server death mode** — killing an app-server takes down **every  
	attached TUI at once**, including other teams' agents that had nothing to do  
	with the kill. Prevention points at G555's attribution rules: this is the  
	second-order cost of an attribution violation, where the victim is everything  
	attached to the process rather than the process itself.

### Release-flow hardening (G557)

The first live execution of the v0.6.1 post-release version roll turned child  
main red on four checks: three tests pinned the `stableVersion` / `nextVersion`  
pair **by value**, and the G475 guard requires release notes to exist for  
whatever `nextVersion` names. An unrelated PR inherited the red main and was  
frozen until this landed.

- **Version-agnostic assertions.** A literal version pair is the wrong assertion  
	for a field a *required recurring step* is supposed to change — pinning it  
	guarantees that a correct roll breaks the test. The three assertions now derive  
	from `eng/version.json` through one shared source and assert the property that  
	holds across every roll: the policy parses, and the release-to-be-cut is  
	strictly ahead of the published stable. A **roll-simulation fixture** (next  
	patch, minor rollover, major rollover) proves they stay green, so the  
	regression is expressible rather than merely fixed.
- **The draft-stub mechanism.** The roll now creates clearly-marked **DRAFT**  
	`release-notes-v<nextVersion>.md` stubs in the same commit. They satisfy the  
	G475 guard with **its semantics unchanged** — existence is still required; it  
	is simply now possible to satisfy at roll time — and they block a Release by  
	their own contract until release-prep fills them in. *(These notes are that  
	release-prep for v0.6.2.)*
- **The roll rule completed.** The release closeout checklist now includes stub  
	creation with the version bump **and** a final step requiring the roller to  
	verify child main CI green after pushing: a red main blocks every unrelated PR  
	that inherits it, so the roll is complete only when CI is.

## Install

```
dotnet tool install -g JTechJapan.IntentSystem.Cli --version 0.6.2
```

Or download the self-contained binary from the  
[v0.6.2 GitHub Release](https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system/releases/tag/v0.6.2).  
Verify the `.sha256` sidecar before use.

## Upgrade from v0.6.1

```
dotnet tool update -g JTechJapan.IntentSystem.Cli --version 0.6.2
```

This release is **additive on the guide surfaces and corrective in the release  
flow**. There are no new commands and no argument/flag changes.

- **Additive — guidance only, no action needed.** G555 and G556 extend  
	`intent-cli guide orchestrator-thread` output (and the mirrored ja/en  
	orchestration docs) with new sections and fields. Nothing that consumed the  
	guide before behaves differently; there is simply more of it. If you supervise  
	a shared machine or provision teams, **read the two new sections** — they  
	encode incidents that cost other teams outages.
- **Corrective — release-flow only.** G557 changes how the repository's own  
	release tooling is asserted and how the post-release roll is performed. It  
	affects maintainers cutting a release, not consumers of the CLI:
	- the version-policy assertions no longer pin a literal version pair, so a  
		correct roll no longer breaks them;
		- the post-release roll now creates DRAFT notes stubs and requires a green-CI  
		check before it counts as complete.

No package id, license, or CLI argument/flag shape changes.

## Release-readiness gate (G558)

These items must hold **before the GitHub Release for `v0.6.2` is published**.  
This gate fails closed — if any item is unmet, do not publish the Release yet.

- Every release-bound packet is **complete and its PR merged to `main`**:  
	G555 (PR [#1214](https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system/pull/1214)), G556 (PR [#1218](https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system/pull/1218)), and G557 (PR [#1216](https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system/pull/1216)), plus this G558  
	release-prep. Confirm on the host/review side via the host queue-state /  
	GitHub PR state — the child implementation loop must not read parent  
	queue-state, so this is a host-owned precondition.
- **These notes are no longer a draft.** The G557 stub contract blocks a  
	Release while the file still carries its DRAFT banner; this file replacing  
	it is what lifts that block.
- No open intent-system PR or WIP packet intended for this release is  
	accidentally skipped (check the host queue / open PR list before  
	publishing).
- `eng/version.json` shows `stableVersion` `0.6.1` and `nextVersion` `0.6.2`  
	(the intended release version), **unchanged by this packet**.
- Package metadata is correct: `PackageId = JTechJapan.IntentSystem.Cli`,  
	`RepositoryUrl` / `PackageProjectUrl` point to  
	`https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system`,  
	`PackageLicenseExpression = Apache-2.0`, README/docs links resolve, and  
	the official service site `https://www.intent-driven-development.com/` is  
	linked from the README.
- **Main CI is green** (`Build and test (source contract)`) on the release  
	commit, and the **preview-pack** workflow is green.
- **Post-merge build + pack evidence** on the merge commit is recorded in  
	the PR (mirroring the G528/G538/G551/G554 readiness gate).

## Publishing v0.6.2

This packet does **not** publish the release and adds **no** publish steps. The  
merge of these notes does **not** create a GitHub Release or tag on its own.

1. After this packet is merged and the readiness gate above holds, a  
	**maintainer/operator (or external release automation) creates and publishes  
	the GitHub Release** for `v0.6.2` (tagging the release commit). This is a  
	post-merge host/operator/external action.
2. Publishing that GitHub Release fires `.github/workflows/release.yml`  
	(`on: release: published`), which builds and publishes the NuGet package and  
	the per-platform binary archives (with `.sha256` checksums) and attaches them  
	to the triggering Release.

Post-release verification (after the GitHub Release is published and  
`release.yml` has run):

- NuGet.org package page links all resolve correctly.
- GitHub release asset links (`.tar.gz`, `.zip`, `.exe`, `.nupkg`) are  
	accessible.
- `.sha256` checksums match the downloaded artifacts.
- `dotnet tool update -g JTechJapan.IntentSystem.Cli` (or  
	`dotnet tool install -g JTechJapan.IntentSystem.Cli --version 0.6.2`)  
	then `intent-cli --version` reports `0.6.2`.
- Binary artifact smoke check: download the platform archive, verify its  
	`.sha256`, extract, and run `./intent-cli --version` → `0.6.2`.
- **Guide smoke** (G555/G556): `intent-cli guide orchestrator-thread --format markdown` renders both the `Cross-project isolation on a shared machine` section and the `Verified liveness` subsection.
- **ROLL `eng/version.json` NOW**, per the G554 rule as amended by G557:  
	`stableVersion → 0.6.2`, `nextVersion → 0.6.3`, **in the same commit as  
	new DRAFT `release-notes-v0.6.3.md` stubs (EN/JA)**, then **verify child  
	main CI is green** before calling the roll complete. See  
	[Version flow](https://github.com/J-Tech-Japan/intent-system/blob/v0.6.2/09-developer-reference.md#version-flow).
- Notify the operator and downstream consumers that publication **and**  
	verification of `v0.6.2` are complete. (The publish request itself belongs  
	to the pre-release phase above; by this point the Release is already  
	published.)
