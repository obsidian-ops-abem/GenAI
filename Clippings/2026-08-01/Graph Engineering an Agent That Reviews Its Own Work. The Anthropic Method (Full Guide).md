Your agent is not dumb. It is shaped wrong.

Short tasks work. You ask for a function, you get a function. Then you point the same agent at something real, a refactor across forty files, a migration, a research job that runs for an hour, and it drifts. It forgets a decision it made twenty minutes ago. It fixes one file and breaks another. You restart it, and it starts from zero.

The instinct is to blame the model. Usually the model is fine. The shape of the work is wrong.

# Loops and graphs

Most agents are loops. The model thinks, calls a tool, reads the result, thinks again, and repeats until it decides it is done. Control lives inside the model. You see the input and the output, and almost nothing in between. When it fails at minute forty, you do not know which minute it went wrong.

A graph moves control outside the model. You define the steps, what connects to what, and where state lives. The model still does the thinking, but inside nodes you drew. Some nodes do not use a model at all: a script, a compiler, a test suite.

Four things change when you do this. You can see where it failed, because failure happens at a named node. You can resume, because state sits on disk instead of in a context window. You can run independent branches at the same time. And you can make the boring parts deterministic instead of paying a model to guess.

# This is not theory

Last month Anthropic engineers migrated ten code packages this way.

Jarred Sumner ported Bun from Zig to Rust. A million lines of code in under two weeks, with the entire existing test suite passing in CI before the merge landed. Nineteen regressions surfaced afterward, all fixed. The Rust port shipped inside Claude Code in June.

Mike Krieger took a Python codebase to 165,000 lines of TypeScript over a weekend. Hundreds of agents, eight phase gates, three adversarial review rounds, and a final check that diffed every command's output against the Python original.

The Bun migration burned 5.9 billion uncached input tokens and 690 million output tokens, roughly $165,000 at API pricing. Worth knowing, because this is not a free technique. It is a technique that makes a $3 million four year project into a two week one.

Neither engineer called their setup a graph. They described queues, gates, reviewers and daemons. That is a graph, drawn in scripts instead of a diagram.

# The one principle everything else follows from

Anthropic states it in a single line: you do not fix the code, you fix the process that produced the code.

When a reviewer catches the same mistake in the third file, the wrong move is to fix three files. The right move is to add one sentence to the rules and regenerate the batch. Individual failures are the loop's job. Your attention belongs on the patterns.

This is the part people skip, and it is the part that makes the difference. If you find yourself hand-patching agent output, you are working inside the agent's job instead of building the thing that does it.

The rest of this is how to build that thing.

# How to build the graph

Everything below lives in one folder. Make it now:

```text
mkdir -p agent/{source,output,rules,scripts,logs}
```

You will end up with six files that do the actual work. Each step adds one.

## Step 1. Build the judge before anything else

An agent without an exit condition never finishes. It stops when it feels done, which is not a condition, it is a mood.

Before writing a single instruction about the work itself, decide how a machine tells you the work is correct. Not you reading the output. A machine.

Create scripts/judge.sh. It takes one file, returns exit code 0 for pass and 1 for fail, and prints why:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# judge.sh <file>
FILE=$1
[ -s "$FILE" ] || { echo "FAIL: empty"; exit 1; }
grep -q "required_section" "$FILE" || { echo "FAIL: missing section"; exit 1; }
echo "PASS"; exit 0
```

For code, this wraps your test runner. For documents, it checks required sections and forbidden patterns. For data, it validates schema and row counts. When a check is too fuzzy for bash, the judge calls a model with the source material and a yes/no question, and parses the answer.

Anthropic's prerequisite step is this: they sorted existing tests into ones runnable against both codebases and ones that were not, then rewrote the portable ones into assertions that work against either side.

You have a judge when you can answer this without opening the output: what command tells me this passed?

## Step 2. Break the judge on purpose

A judge that never fails is decoration.

```bash
cp output/known_good.md /tmp/broken.md
sed -i 's/required_section//' /tmp/broken.md
./scripts/judge.sh /tmp/broken.md   # must print FAIL
./scripts/judge.sh output/known_good.md   # must print PASS
```

If the broken copy passes, your judge is blind and every green result after this point is meaningless. Anthropic validates in both directions for the same reason: against the original to confirm it passes, against deliberately broken code to confirm it fails.

Do this before generating anything at scale.

## Step 3. Write the rulebook, and never patch around it

Create rules/rulebook.md. This is what every worker reads before touching anything.

Structure it in sections, because you will be adding to it constantly:

```markdown
# Rulebook

## Output format
- One file per input, same filename, .md extension
- Never wrap output in code fences

## Conventions
- Dates as YYYY-MM-DD
- Never invent a value that is not in the source

## Edge cases
- Source missing a title: use the filename, flag it
- Source over 5000 words: split at the top-level headings

## When you cannot proceed
Write TODO(agent): <reason> in place and continue
```

Build it by talking through ambiguities out loud with Claude. Every time you think "well, in that case it should probably...", that is a rule. Write it down.

Two properties make it work. It grows: every reviewer catch that the rules did not cover becomes a new sentence. And nothing bypasses it: the moment you hand-edit output to match what the rulebook should have said, you have two sources of truth and one of them is in your head.

Jarred worked through each area of ambiguity with Claude, then ran eight subagents whose only job was reviewing for eight specific failure categories he expected from experience.

## Step 4. Stress-test the rules on three items, then delete the work

Run three items two different ways:

```bash
# with the rulebook
claude -p "Read rules/rulebook.md. Process source/item1.md. Write to output/." 

# without it
claude -p "Process source/item1.md well. Write to /tmp/control/."
```

Diff them:

```bash
diff output/item1.md /tmp/control/item1.md
```

Every difference is a place where your rules are wrong, missing, or worse than the model's default. Fix the rulebook, not the files.

Jarred caught two critical issues at this stage that would have propagated across all 1,448 files.

Then delete everything you produced:

```bash
rm -rf output/* /tmp/control
```

All of it. The goal was never the three files, it was the rules. Keeping this output is how you end up with the first three items following one convention and everything else following another.

## Step 5. Put state on disk, not in the context window

This is the change that makes long runs survivable.

Create scripts/queue.sh. It rebuilds the work queue from the filesystem every single run:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for f in source/*.md; do
  name=$(basename "$f")
  [ -f "output/$name" ] || echo "$f"
done
```

Nothing about the queue lives in a conversation. Then scripts/run.sh drives it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
BATCH=5
./scripts/queue.sh | head -$BATCH | while read f; do
  claude -p "Read rules/rulebook.md. Process $f. Write result to output/$(basename $f)." &
done
wait
```

Run it in a loop until the queue empties:

```bash
while [ -n "$(./scripts/queue.sh)" ]; do ./scripts/run.sh; done
```

Anthropic describes exactly this: a batch script decides what is done by checking whether the output file exists on disk, then slices the pending files into batches.

The consequence matters. Your process is resumable by construction. Kill it at 60 percent, restart it, and it picks up at 60 percent because the disk remembers. No context window, no chat history, no "where were we".

## Step 6. Use two reviewers who cannot see each other

One reviewer in the same context as the worker will agree with the worker. It has seen the reasoning and it is primed to accept it.

Create scripts/review.sh and run two fresh sessions per item:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FILE=$1
for n in 1 2; do
  claude -p "Read rules/rulebook.md. Review $FILE against those rules only. \
For each problem output: RULE: <the rule violated> | ISSUE: <what is wrong>. \
If nothing violates a rule, output PASS." > logs/review_$n.txt
done

if ! diff -q logs/review_1.txt logs/review_2.txt >/dev/null; then
  claude -p "Two reviewers disagree on $FILE. Reviewer 1: $(cat logs/review_1.txt). \
Reviewer 2: $(cat logs/review_2.txt). Decide which findings are real." \
  > logs/review_final.txt
fi
```

Each reviewer sees the output and the rulebook, nothing else. No worker reasoning, no chat history.

Forcing a rule citation on every finding is the detail that closes the loop. A citation turns a vague complaint into a queue item. And a rule cited three times across different files is not three problems, it is one badly written rule. Rewrite that line in the rulebook and rerun the affected batch.

Disagreement between the two reviewers usually means the rulebook is ambiguous at that spot. That is an edit, not a coin flip.

## Step 7. Make the boring checks deterministic, and place them by cost

Anything a script can verify should never be verified by a model. Faster, cheaper, no opinions.

Then decide where each check sits based on how long it takes.

**Fast checks go inside the loop.** Add the judge directly to your worker call:

```bash
claude -p "..." && ./scripts/judge.sh "output/$name" || echo "$name" >> logs/failed.txt
```

Mike ran the TypeScript compiler on every unit because it returns in seconds.

**Slow checks go outside, in batches.** Let the whole queue finish, then run the expensive check once:

```bash
./scripts/expensive_check.sh > logs/errors.txt
sort logs/errors.txt | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

Jarred banned the compiler from the loop entirely because cargo takes minutes. He ran it once across the workspace, then dispatched fixer agents against the error list in parallel.

Same problem, opposite decisions, both correct. The rule is not "check often", it is: match check frequency to check cost.

That uniq -c | sort -rn line matters more than it looks. It shows you categories instead of individual errors. Jarred hit thousands of Rust module errors from cyclic imports Zig had tolerated. The fix was not thousands of fixes, it was one classification rule added to the loop.

## Step 8. Serialize the expensive operation

If one operation dominates cost or time, do not let every agent trigger it.

Agents write requests to a directory instead of running the operation:

```bash
# worker writes a request, never rebuilds
echo "$name" >> queue/rebuild_requests
```

A single daemon owns it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/daemon.sh
while true; do
  if [ -s queue/rebuild_requests ]; then
    mv queue/rebuild_requests queue/processing
    ./scripts/rebuild.sh            # runs once for the whole batch
    ./scripts/test_affected.sh queue/processing > logs/results.txt
    rm queue/processing
  fi
  sleep 10
done
```

Anthropic's version is a build daemon: the only process allowed to rebuild the binary. Fixers write patches, the daemon batches them, rebuilds once, reruns affected tests, feeds results back.

Ten agents each triggering a full rebuild means paying ten times for work that batches into one.

## One more thing: pick models by role

Do not run your largest model everywhere.

```bash
claude -p "..." --model sonnet   # workers, high volume
claude -p "..." --model opus     # reviewers, rule writing
```

Mike fanned out twelve subagents on Sonnet for the main migration. Save the large model for two jobs: reviewers, and anything that writes rules other agents will follow. A bad rule propagates into every downstream output, which is exactly where capability is worth paying for.

# When you should not do this

A graph needs you to know the shape of the work before you start. That is the whole trade.

Skip it when:

- **The task runs once.** All the setup here is amortized across repetitions. Building a judge and a rulebook to process eleven files is slower than doing the eleven files.
- **You do not know the steps yet.** Research, debugging something unfamiliar, exploring a codebase you have never seen. A loop will find a path you would not have drawn. Locking the topology early just locks in your wrong guess about what the work involves.
- **There is no mechanical judge and there cannot be.** If correctness genuinely requires your taste on every item, no script will replace you, and the reviewer nodes turn into theatre.
- The honest version: most of what people do with agents is one-off and exploratory, and a loop is correct for that. The graph earns its setup cost when the same shape of work repeats hundreds of times and a machine can tell right from wrong.

There is a middle path worth knowing. Run a loop first to learn the shape, keep notes on every correction you make, and those notes are your first rulebook. Then build the graph for the second run.

# The actual shift

The question was never whether the model is smart enough.

It is who decides what happens next. In a loop, the model decides, and you find out at the end. In a graph, you decided in advance, and the model executes inside the boundaries you drew.

That is why Anthropic's line is the whole thing in nine words: you do not fix the code, you fix the process that produced the code. Every step above is a mechanism for making that possible. State on disk so failures are recoverable. Citations on findings so mistakes point at rules. Categories instead of individual errors so you see patterns rather than instances.

The million-line migration is not impressive because the model wrote a million lines. It is impressive because when something went wrong at line 400,000, there was a named place where it went wrong, and fixing it meant editing one sentence and rerunning a batch.

Pick the process you have been doing by hand, the one that repeats. Write the judge for it first. Everything else follows from having an exit condition.
